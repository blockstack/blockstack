## About

Blockstack is a decentralized computing network which currently has
165+ apps built on top [https://blockstack.org].

Blockstack believes that the "traditional internet" has become too
dependent on a handful of companies. Blockstack wants to take the
internet back to its decentralized roots. The Blockstack network is a
product of 4+ years of R&D and infrastructure building. Blockstack
gives developers the right tools to build decentralized apps.

The big difference between these and traditional internet apps is that: 

1. Apps mostly run client-side (no servers or databases)
2. Users are in control of their data with encrypted private data lockers
3. Users have universal cryptographic logins without any third-party providers.

Blockstack PBC is a public benefit corporation building the core
protocols and developer tools for decentralized computing. Developers
use our open-source reference implementations and SDKs to build
decentralized apps. These include Graphite (decentralized Google
docs), Dmail (encrypted email), BitPatron (decentralized Patreon), and
others [https://app.co/blockstack]. The Blockstack software stack
gives developers decentralized solutions for auth and storage. The
Stacks V2 blockchain will further allow developers to develop and
launch smart contracts.

The Stacks blockchain is a foundational layer of our architecture. It
enables our decentralized qauth and storage to work without
centralized operators. Users register their usernames on the Stacks
blockchain and link their storage credentials. Technical details of
our full decentralized computing stack are at
[https://blockstack.org/whitepaper.pdf].

Stacks is the native crypto token of Blockstack. Stacks are used as
"fuel" to register digital assets and, once such functionality is
launched, execute smart contracts. Compared to other decentralized app
platforms, we:

1. Keep on-chain logic to a minimum 
2. Scale apps by localizing state changes
3. Enable developers to write general-purpose apps, not just smart contracts

### Stacks Version 2

Development of Stacks version 2 (described in our whitepaper:
[https://blockstack.org/whitepaper.pdf]) is in progress in the `develop`
branch of [`blockstack-core`](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/tree/develop/).

Stacks version 2 introduces support for [Clarity Smart
Contracts](https://blog.blockstack.org/introducing-clarity-the-language-for-predictable-smart-contracts/).
Clarity is a smart contracting language that optimizes for predictability and security.
Clarity is currently in "a developer preview" mode, with releases of the Clarity VM and typechecker
available via builds on the `develop` branch of `blockstack-core`.

## Contributing Guidelines

When contributing to Blockstack repositories
[https://github.com/blockstack], follow the relevant repository's
contributing guidelines. You can also reference
our [engineering guide](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack/blob/master/engineering/README.md) for
more advice.

## Code

If you're just starting with Blockstack, here are the main software repositories you should checkout:

- [Blockstack Core](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core) - the reference implementation of the Stacks blockchain. Active development of Stacks V2 is under way in the `develop` branch.
- [Blockstack Browser](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser) - the Blockstack Browser provides a graphical interface for interactions with the network.
- [blockstack.js](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js) - a JavaScript library for using Blockstack identity, authentication, and gaia storage in your apps.
